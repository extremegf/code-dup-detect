This project aims to assist users practicing TDD.

In the second step of TDD you are asked to remove duplication from your code.
But sometimes it gets difficult to spot it. This tool generates a html report
from give source file, highlighting duplicated code lines.

The tool is language agnostic. It operates on lines and tokens.

If you're interested in helping me, pull requests are welcome.
HOWEVER! You must submit full tests TDD style :) That's the whole point of
the tool...
