This project aims to assist users practicing TDD.

In the second step of TDD you are asked to remove duplication from your code.
But sometimes it gets difficult to spot it. This tool generates a html report
from give source file, highlighting duplicated code lines.

The tool is language agnostic. It operates on lines and tokens.
